# üí∞ Simple Interest Calculator

This project provides a straightforward and efficient calculator for determining **simple interest**. It takes into account the principal amount, the annual rate of interest, and the duration in years to deliver an accurate calculation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Effortless Calculation:** Computes simple interest with a single, clear formula.
* **Intuitive Inputs:** Clearly defines the parameters required for calculation.
* **Direct & Understandable Output:** Provides the simple interest value instantly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The calculator operates on the fundamental principle of simple interest, using the following well-known formula:

$$\text{Simple Interest} = P \times T \times R$$

Where:
* $P$: Represents the **Principal amount** (the initial sum of money deposited or borrowed).
* $T$: Denotes the **Time period** for which the money is borrowed or invested, expressed in **years**.
* $R$: Stands for the **Annual rate of interest**, which should be provided as a **decimal** (e.g., 5% should be entered as 0.05).

## ‚û°Ô∏è Inputs Required

To get your simple interest calculation, you will need to provide three values:

* `p`: The **principal amount** (e.g., `1000` for $1000).
* `t`: The **time period** in years (e.g., `3` for 3 years).
* `r`: The **annual rate of interest** (e.g., `0.04` for 4%).

---

## ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Output

The calculator will return a single value:

* `simple interest`: The total simple interest accrued over the specified period.

## üéØ Example Usage

Let's illustrate with an example:

Suppose you invest `$5000` at an annual interest rate of `6%` for `10` years.

* $P = 5000$
* $T = 10$
* $R = 0.06$

Applying the formula:

$$\text{Simple Interest} = 5000 \times 10 \times 0.06 = 3000$$

The simple interest earned would be `$3000`.
